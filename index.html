    <p>Hello, I'm Emily, and I'm here to help make the journey of finding gender-affirming clothing a little bit easier and a lot more fun. I have lived in Seattle for 16 years, coming here out of college as a Software Engineer and eventually moving into Management. I have two young children and an old, cuddly dog.
</p>
    <p>My partner of 16 years, Erin, came out as a trans woman in the spring of 2024, and since then, we've been navigating the many changes that come with embracing one's true self. One of the challenges she encountered early in the transition was finding clothing that reflects her identity and makes her feel confident and feminine.
</p>
    <p>Changing your wardrobe to align with your identity can be daunting. How do you discover what style fits you best? Where do you shop? And how do you build the confidence to explore new looks in stores or online? Erin and I faced these questions together. With my love for shopping, I helped Erin try out different styles in the comfort of our home and supported her as she ventured into stores, turning shopping into an exciting and affirming experience.
</p>
    <p>One of my skills is my knack for skimming clothing racks and finding those hidden gems that you might overlook. I've always enjoyed picking out outfits for people, helping them discover clothing that suits their style and personality. Through this process with Erin, I've realized that not everyone has the support they need during such a significant transition. That's why I'm reaching out to offer help to others who are on a similar journey. Whether offering encouragement, picking out clothes from crowded racks, suggesting new styles, or simply being a shopping companion, I want to support you as you rediscover your style and express your true self.
</p>
    <p>Best of all, at this point, this support is completely free. If you're interested, please fill the following form where you can share your style preferences, budget, and a bit about yourself, and we can start this journey together. Let's transform shopping into an empowering experience for you!
</p>
