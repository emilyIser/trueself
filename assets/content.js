One of the challenges she encountered early in the transition was finding clothing that reflects her identity and makes her feel confident and feminine.",

And how do you build the confidence to explore new looks in stores or online? Erin and I faced these questions together. With my love for shopping, I helped Erin try out different styles in the comfort of our home and supported her as she ventured into stores, turning shopping into an exciting and affirming experience."
